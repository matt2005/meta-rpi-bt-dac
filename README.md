# meta-rpi-bt-dac

Yocto layer to build Bluetooth DAC image for Raspberry Pi Zero W + pHAT DAC.

## Description

This layer extends the meta-raspberrypi BSP layer and builds a Linux image that allows to use Raspberry Pi Zero W and DAC hat as a Bluetooth audio sink. When the device is powered on, it will automatically become discoverable by Bluetooth. Pairing can be done without a pin, and the Pi is then recognized as a Bluetooth audio device (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile, A2DP).

## Hardware

[Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)

[pHAT DAC](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/phat-dac)

## Pre-built images

Latest pre-built image can be found from the [Releases](https://github.com/spietika/meta-rpi-bt-dac/releases) page. It can be directly flashed to a SD card.

## Dependencies

This layer depends on:

* URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
    * branch: dunfell

* URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
    * layers: meta-oe, meta-networking, meta-python
    * branch: dunfell

* URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
    * branch: dunfell

## Quick Start

1. Clone the dependencies and switch to correct branch
2. source poky/oe-init-build-env build
3. Add this layer to build/conf/bblayers.conf and the dependencies above
4. Set MACHINE in local.conf to raspberrypi0-wifi
    * To remove unnecessary features, the following can also be added to local.conf:
    * `MACHINE_FEATURES_remove = "apm wifi screen touchscreen"`
    * `DISTRO_FEATURES_remove = "ipv4 ipv6 irda usbgadget usbhost wifi nfs zeroconf 3g nfc x11 wayland vulkan"`
    * For read-only root filesystem, add `IMAGE_FEATURES += "read-only-rootfs"` to local.conf. When using read-only rootfs also `SERIAL_CONSOLES_CHECK = ""` needs to be set to local.conf.
5. Add `IMAGE_FSTYPES_append = " rpi-sdimg"` to local.conf to produce ready-to-flash SD image
6. bitbake core-image-base
7. dd to a SD card the generated sdimg file (build/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi0-wifi/core-image-base-raspberrypi0-wifi.rpi-sdimg)
8. Boot your RPI.
